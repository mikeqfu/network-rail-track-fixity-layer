## Introduction

This project aims to develop a data mining tool to assist engineers in analysing and predicting track movements over time. The analysis is based on recorded asset data, local operational and environmental factors and knowledge of track design in the area. In this prototype phase, the team focused on assembling a structured dataset for a representative track section to develop data-driven models of track movement, identify key track geometry parameters predicting future movements and generate fixity values for all reference curves used on the GB rail network.


## Key achievements

The project has resulted in the following key achievements:
- **Data integration and management**: A data cleaning and pre-processing workflow has been developed using the open-source PostgreSQL database. This workflow enables smooth integration and management of the data corpus. Initially, six industry data streams were used (CARRS, CNM, OPAS, ballast type, track quality, and point cloud surveys). The workflow is easily extensible, allowing for the inclusion of additional data sets in the future, provided they are referenced linearly (e.g., ELR + track mileage) or using standard geographic coordinate systems.
- **Predictive machine learning model**: A machine learning model was trained on data from an 80-km section of the East Coast Main Line south of Edinburgh. This model predicts future track movements, with most predictions falling within the correct bin or within a single bin width of the true value. The model primarily used parameters such as curvature, cant, and maximum speed for its predictions.
- **Python package development**: A three-module Python package has been developed to facilitate the rapid implementation of the described functionalities in software workflows.

These achievements lay the groundwork for further development and refinement in future phases of the project.

## Demo

> **Note:** The following notebook code is for demonstration purposes only. Access to the project's database server will be necessary to successfully instantiate the prototype model. 

```python
>>> from src.modeller.prototype import TrackMovementEstimator

>>> # Specify element, direction and subsection length over which average movement is calculated
>>> element = 'Left Top'
>>> direction = 'Up'
>>> subsect_len = 10

>>> tme = TrackMovementEstimator(element=element, direction=direction, subsect_len=subsect_len)
```
    Initialising the feature collator ... Done.
    Initialising the estimator ... Done.


### 1. Create training and test data sets.
